							<h3>Mark - Stylist</h3>
							<p>NYC hairstylist currently working at Salon Orchard in the Lower East Side. I have a passion for fashion and a flair for hair. My inspiration comes from my everyday life. NYC is so full of interesting things to look at. From the different people, to the amazing architecture, and even the small pieces of nature sprouting out in this concrete jungle I call home. Life is what you make it, I like to make mine beautiful.</p>
